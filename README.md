## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'fog-aws'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install fog-aws

## Usage

Before you can use fog-aws, you must require it in your application:

```ruby
require 'fog/aws'
```

Since it's a bad practice to have your credentials in source code, you should load them from default fog configuration file: ```~/.fog```. This file could look like this:

```
default:
  aws_access_key_id:     <YOUR_ACCESS_KEY_ID>
  aws_secret_access_key: <YOUR_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY>
```

### EC2

#### Connecting to the EC2 Service:

```ruby
ec2 = Fog::Compute.new :provider => 'AWS', :region => 'us-west-2'
```

You can review all the requests available with this service using ```#requests``` method:

```ruby
ec2.requests # => [:allocate_address, :assign_private_ip_addresses, :associate_address, ...]
```

#### Launch an EC2 on-demand instance:

```ruby
response = ec2.run_instances(
  "ami-23ebb513",
  1,
  1,
  "InstanceType"  => "t1.micro",
  "SecurityGroup" => "ssh",
  "KeyName"       => "miguel"
)
instance_id = response.body["instancesSet"].first["instanceId"] # => "i-02db5af4"
instance = ec2.servers.get(instance_id)
instance.wait_for { ready? }
puts instance.public_ip_address # => "356.300.501.20"
```

#### Terminate an EC2 instance:

```ruby
instance = ec2.servers.get("i-02db5af4")
instance.destroy
```

`Fog::AWS` is more than EC2 since it supports many services provided by AWS. The best way to learn and to know about how many services are supported is to take a look at the source code. To review the tests directory and to play with the library in ```bin/console``` can be very helpful resources as well.

### S3

#### Connecting to the S3 Service:

```ruby
s3 = Fog::Storage.new(provider: 'AWS', region: 'eu-central-1')
```

#### Creating a file:

```ruby
directory = s3.directories.new(key: 'gaudi-portal-dev')
file = directory.files.create(key: 'user/1/Gemfile', body: File.open('Gemfile'), tags: 'Org-Id=1&Service-Name=My-Service')
```

#### Listing files:

```ruby
directory = s3.directories.get('gaudi-portal-dev', prefix: 'user/1/')
directory.files
```
**Warning!** `s3.directories.get` retrieves and caches meta data for the first 10,000 objects in the bucket, which can be very expensive. When possible use `s3.directories.new`.

#### Generating a URL for a file:

```ruby
directory.files.new(key: 'user/1/Gemfile').url(Time.now + 60)
```

#### Copying a file

```ruby
directory = s3.directories.new(key: 'gaudi-portal-dev')
file = directory.files.get('user/1/Gemfile')
file.copy("target-bucket", "user/2/Gemfile.copy")
```

To speed transfers of large files, the `concurrency` option can be used
to spawn multiple threads. Note that the file must be at least 5 MB for
multipart uploads to work. For example:

```ruby
directory = s3.directories.new(key: 'gaudi-portal-dev')
file = directory.files.get('user/1/Gemfile')
file.multipart_chunk_size = 10 * 1024 * 1024
file.concurrency = 10
file.copy("target-bucket", "user/2/Gemfile.copy")
```
